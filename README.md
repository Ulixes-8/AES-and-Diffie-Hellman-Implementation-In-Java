This repository contains Java implementations of two secure communication protocols designed to ensure encrypted, authenticated, and confidential data exchange between a client and server. The protocols demonstrate core cryptographic principles:

Protocol 1: A simple symmetric encryption-based communication protocol using AES, nonce exchange, and session key derivation via XOR.
Protocol 2: A more advanced protocol utilizing the Diffie-Hellman key exchange for secure session key establishment, coupled with AES encryption for subsequent data exchanges.

This code was written as a solution to an assignment given in a course titled "Security and Networks" at the University of Birmingham.
